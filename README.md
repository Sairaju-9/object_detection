# object_detection
This repository contains code and files for object detection using SSD (Single Shot Detector) algorithm. The code is written in Python and uses OpenCV library for image processing. The ssd_files folder contains the trained SSD model and the label map file. The object.py file is the main script that performs object detection on a video file. The test-2.mp4 file is a sample video for testing the code. To run the code, you need to install the required libraries and execute the following command:

python object.py

The code will display the video with bounding boxes and labels for the detected objects.
